    <p><a id="user"></a><b>User</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>Users have one to many roles, and can belong to zero to many UserGroups.  Both Users and
	UserGroups implement the OwnerExecutor interface so that Users and UserGroups can be the
	owner and/or executor of a Checklist.</dd>
	</dl>
</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="userGroup"></a><b>UserGroup</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>A UserGroup serves to group a set of users so that any user in that group can be an
	owner or executor of a checklist.  A User can belong to zero or more UserGroups.</dd>
	</dl>
</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="ownerExecutor"></a><b>OwnerExecutor</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>The OwnerExecutor interface is implemented by both the User and UserGroup classes so
	that either Users or UserGroups can be the Owner or Executor of a Checklist.</dd>
	</dl>
</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="checklist"></a><b>Checklist</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>The Checklist class defines a set of steps used to accomplish some sort of goal
	or complete a complex task.  An example would be a Saturday test.  There could be a Checklist
	that defines the Saturday test, and the Checklist would include Step objects that define
	the Steps necessary to complete the Saturday test.  Steps can be dependent upon one another, as
	described in the section about the Step class.
	<br><br>
	It may be useful to think about the Checklist class as defining the template for a Checklist.
	When a Checklist is going to be used to track work, an ExecutionChecklist is created that is
	effectively a clone of the Checklist.  A Checklist is related to an ExecutionChecklist like
	a Java class is related to an object.
	<br><br>
	Here's a quick use case:  Suppose you want to define a checklist that you are going to use when
	you go on a campout.  You would create a Checklist that defines all of the steps
	needed to prepare for the campout.  You might do this several weeks before the campout.  When you are
	ready to use your checklist to start tracking your progress, you would execute the Checklist, which
	would create an ExecutionChecklist.  The ExecutionChecklist is a copy of the Checklist, and has additional
	attributes like executionStart and executionEnd.  The original Checklist could be reused at any point
	later when you want to prepare for another campout.  You would just execute it again.

</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="checklistGroup"></a><b>Checklist Group</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>A ChecklistGroup serves to group and categorize checklists.  Each ChecklistGroup can have a type
	of public or private.  The checklists in a public group can be viewed by all users of the Checklist
	application.  Checklists in a private group can only be viewed by the owner, executor and
	defaultExecutor of a Checklist or ExecutionChecklist.</dd>
	</dl>
</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="step"></a><b>Step</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>A Step defines a task to be done as part of a Checklist.  Steps can be dependent upon
	other tasks through the preconditions relationship.  If a Step has another Step defined as
	a precondition, that Step cannot be executed until the precondition has been executed.  If
	none of the steps in a Checklist have preconditions, all Steps can be executed in parallel.</dd>
	</dl>
</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="executionChecklist"></a><b>Execution Checklist</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>An ExecutionChecklist is created when a Checklist is executed, and is effectively a copy
	of the Checklist.  The ExecutionChecklist and ExecutionStep classes contain additional fields 
	such as executionStart and executionEnd which are used to track the actual execution of
	the checklist and can be used to view progress.  Once an ExecutionChecklist is created,
	the ExecutionChecklist and ExecutionSteps can be changed without affecting the Checklist
	from which the ExecutionChecklist was created.  The ExecutionChecklist will also not change
	if the Checklist from which it was created is modified.</dd>
	</dl>
</li>
<li>
    <p><a id="executionStep"></a><b>Execution Step</b></p>
	<dl>
	<dd>When a Checklist is executed and an ExecutionChecklist is created, all of the Checklist
	Steps are also copied into ExecutionStep instances.</dd>
	</dl>
